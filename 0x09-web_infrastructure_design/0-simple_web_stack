You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:

1. SPOF: Single Point Of Failure this is a potential issue bound to happen in this kind of infrastructure, because it is dependent on only one server.

2. Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted) - Problem: During the restart or maintenance window, the services provided by the web server become temporarily unavailable.

3 Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic: When there is a surge in traffic, the current infrastructure may not be able to efficiently scale to meet the demand, resulting in degraded performance or serviceÂ outages.
